			<p class="about-content">
				Hi, my name is Brandon Shihabi! I'm a Software Engineer who specializes in low-level programming, particularly Game Engines and Rendering.
				I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at UCLA and have professional experience working on AAA Games and Graphics tech.
			</p>
			<p class="about-content">
				This summer I worked at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="paragraph-url" href="https://insomniac.games/">Insomniac Games</a> 
				as the Core Rendering Intern and helped ship Marvel's Spider-Man 2. I helped maintain our proprietary Game Engine by optimizing performance,
				fixing rendering bugs, and improving graphical fidelity.
			</p>
			<p class="about-content">
				I have also developed my own personal Game Engines and Renderers, including a Vulkan Game Engine for Linux and a D3D12 Renderer 
				that supports has real-time ray-traced global illumination.

				<h2 class="experience-subheader">JUN. 2023 - SEP. 2023 | Managed by Al Hastings (Chief Engine Architect)</h1>
				<p class="experience-description">
					I worked on the core rendering team to help maintain and improve our proprietary Game Engine on 
					<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="paragraph-url" href="https://insomniac.games/game/marvels-spider-man-2/">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>.
					I helped ship gold and collaborated with not only the rest of our rendering team but also other departments such as environment and lighting.
				</p>
				<p class="experience-description">
					Using PS5 profiling tools and documentation, I diagnosed bottlenecks of various rendering related systems and optimized performance to reduce 
					GPU starvation and other issues. I also worked to diagnose bugs that were specific to our PS5 graphics context and command buffer
					submission scheme. And I improved graphical fidelity in many different areas throughout the open world.

				<p class="experience-description">
					We often found that many of the same issues would always occur on-site when installing our
					cameras, mainly related to firewall issues. I led the design of a new device that would test for issues over a
					PoE connection and show the user what tests, if any, failed. This device ran a custom firmware I built based on
					Linux. I designed an in-house graphics driver to show the UI on the LCD display and ran a suite of tests to
					check for connectivity, MITM attacks, and more.

				<h1 class="experience-header">D3D12 Renderer</h1>
				<h2 class="experience-subheader">FEB. 2023 - PRESENT</h1>
				<p class="experience-description">
					Athena is my personal experimental renderer that I use to explore the boundaries of graphics. It is built directly off of
					D3D12 and takes advantage of many of the next-generation features that the API provides. A render-graph abstraction is used to
					declare render passes with all resource-transitions and synchronizations handled by the graphics context. It also takes
					full advantage of bindless descriptors using Shader Model 6.6. The renderer uses a deferred shading model and real-time
					ray-tracing to implement dynamic diffuse global illumination using light probes. The demo shown is running at 60 FPS on
					a 3050 ti laptop with <1 ms dedicated to the dynamic global illumination.

				<h2 class="experience-subheader">OCT. 2021 - OCT. 2022</h1>
				<p class="experience-description">
					Vultr is a custom 3D Game Engine I built from scratch for Linux. It uses a Vulkan rendering backend with an editor that
					uses ImGui. It supports run-time type reflection in the editor, gameplay hot-reloading, an ECS system, optimized
					asset imports, and a complete material system. The engine can render PBR graphics with support for roughness,
					metalness, normal, and albedo textures. The meshes, textures, shaders, and all other assets are loaded using
					separate thread submission queues to maximize performance. It also uses a minimal subset of the C++ STL,
					opting for a custom template library where possible.

					BlueBubbles is an iMessage solution for Android, Linux, and Windows that allows you to send and receive Apple
					iMessage texts from non-Apple devices. I started this open-source project in 2020 with some other developers,
					and the app now has over 11,000 active users. I worked on the Android client and designed the Flutter app to
					communicate with our Mac server. The video playing above was created by the Youtube channel HowToMen to 
					showcase our app and has over 350k views.
