			<p class="about-content">
				Hi! My name's Brandon, and I'm a Software Engineer who's been programming for over eight years. I am currently
				studying Computer Science and Engineering at UCLA. I specialize in low-level programming, particularly Game
				Engines and Embedded Systems.
			</p>
			<p class="about-content">
				Professionally, I worked as a Firmware Engineer at a security camera startup called Rhombus Systems and
				developed a brand new device to test and debug cameras over PoE. I created a firmware from scratch based on
				Linux to run on a small 580 MHz CPU that could boot up in seconds and was less than 8 Mb in size.
			</p>
			<p class="about-content">
				In 2020, I created an app with the help of some other developers to allow for iMessage texts to be sent and
				received on non-Apple devices. I worked on the Android side of things to create a client in Flutter that could
				communicate with our Mac server to send and receive texts. The client also had to manage an SQLite database of
				messages synchronized with the server.
			</p>
			<p class="about-content">
				Computer Graphics and Game Engine development are what I enjoy most. I wrote my own custom 3D Game Engine in C++
				using Vulkan with support for PBR and a full blown editor. It is fascinating to see how modern AAA games
				have to run multiple render passes with thousands of polygons all in under 16 ms. I'm currently working on a new
				Game Engine with a professional Game Developer with the goal of making all of my future games in it!

				<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="paragraph-url" href="https://www.rhombus.com/">Rhombus
					Systems</a> is an enterprise security camera startup focused on a cloud-based platform. They provide AI
				services to help monitor video streams automatically. And if customers feel there are more features they want to
				add to their cameras, Rhombus's public-facing API (which is also used internally) can be used to extend
				functionality.

				I interned as a Software Engineer at Rhombus in the summer of 2021. There, I worked on examples for how to use
				the Rhombus API, and all of the work I did is publicly facing on their <a target="_blank"

				Shortly after my internship finished, Rhombus reached out to me to become a part-time Software Engineer while I
				was still in school and later full-time during the summer after I graduated. While at Rhombus, I designed a new
				device to help troubleshoot camera installations. I was also featured in an

				<p class="project-description">
					At Rhombus Systems, we often found that many of the same issues would always occur on-site when installing our
					cameras, mainly related to firewall issues. As a Firmware Engineer at Rhombus, I led the design of a new
					device that would test for issues over a PoE connection and show the user what tests, if any, failed. This
					device ran a custom firmware I built based on Linux. I designed an in-house graphics driver to show the UI on
					the LCD display and ran a suite of tests to check for connectivity, MITM attacks, and more.

					As an intern at Rhombus Systems, I wrote a set of code examples of how to use the Rhombus API. I wrote
					examples in both Typescript and Python that would do things such as classifying objects in real-time using
					Tensorflow or stitching video clips between different cameras to follow a person. I also designed a set of
					shell scripts to generate libraries using Swagger Codegen so that developers could make API requests with the
					safety of having a proper type system.

					Vultr is a custom 3D Game Engine built from scratch. It uses a Vulkan rendering backend with an editor that
					uses ImGui. It supports run-time reflection in the editor, gameplay hot-reloading, an ECS system, optimized
					asset imports, and a complete material system. The engine can render PBR graphics with shaders for roughness,
					metalness, normal, and albedo. The meshes, textures, shaders, and all other assets are loaded using separate
					thread submission queues to maximize performance. It also uses a minimal subset of the C++ STL, opting for a
					custom template library where possible.
