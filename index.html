		<p class="about-content">
			Hi, my name is Brandon Shihabi! I'm a software engineer specializing in low-level programming, particularly game engines and rendering.
			I am currently studying Computer Science at UCLA and have professional experience working on AAA games and graphics tech.
		</p>
		<p class="about-content">
			This summer, I worked as the Core Rendering Intern at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="paragraph-url" href="https://insomniac.games/">Insomniac Games</a>
			working on Wolverine and other Insomniac titles. I worked on our proprietary game engine developing new mesh shading pipelines from scratch for the PS5 to support compression
			and fine-grained culling. I also helped the team ship Marvel's Spider-Man 2 in the summer of 2023 working on performance optimizations and bug fixes to help get the game ready
			for gold and reviewer patch.
		</p>
		<p class="about-content">
			This winter, I'm working as a Graphics Engineering Intern in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="paragraph-url" href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> GPU on
			the Core Animation team who is responsible for the display server and compositing for macOS and iOS. The focus of my work is primarily on frame pacing for games. And previously, during
			the winter of 2024, I worked on the Metal Ecosystems team at Apple where I helped external game developers port their games and engines. I worked with the Metal graphics API and
			implemented an HDR pipeline.
		</p>
		<p class="about-content">
			In my spare time I have developed my own personal engine projects, including a D3D12 renderer that supports real-time ray-traced global illumination and a Vulkan game engine for Linux.

				<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="paragraph-url" href="https://insomniac.games/game/marvels-wolverine/">Marvel's Wolverine</a> and 
				other unnannounced titles. Previously, our engine did not have any support for any mesh shaders. I developed and integrated, from scratch, a mesh shading pipeline
				with real-time decompression of meshlet buffers and custom per meshlet culling solutions to improve performance and reduce memory usage and bandwidth. I added support
				in material pipelines to compile mesh shader versions of all existing materials and implemented APIs in our graphics context to support mesh shading dispatches on both
				PS5 and PC. I also implemented fallback support for GPUs which do not support mesh shaders using emulation with comparable performance.

				Worked on the Metal Ecosystems team helping the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="paragraph-url" href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> 
				game engine port to a Metal backend. I profiled the engine to find performance hot-spots/bottlenecks for improvement and figured out solutions to adapt
				to the TBDR architecture on Apple platforms. I also optimized existing NUMA patterns in engines (such as using staging buffers) to better support UMA.
			</p>

			<p class="experience-description">
				To support HDR on Apple platforms and respond to the luminance headroom, I developed a real-time approximation of the ACES tone-mapping curve which takes in a max
				luminance parameter and creates a tone mapping curve responding to the output headroom and adjusting the shoulder of the curve. And since Godot has no support for HDR
				in the engine at all, I implemented a from scratch HDR 10 implementation for the Metal backend with a PQ transfer function and proper Rec. 2020 color space conversion.

			<p class="experience-description">
				Athena is my personal experimental renderer that I use to explore the boundaries of graphics. It is built directly off of
				D3D12 and takes advantage of many of the next-generation features that the API provides. A render-graph abstraction is used to
				declare render passes with all resource-transitions and synchronizations handled by the graphics context. It also takes
				full advantage of bindless descriptors using Shader Model 6.6. The renderer uses a deferred shading model and real-time
				ray-tracing to implement dynamic diffuse global illumination using light probes. It also features temporal anti-aliasing and
				depth of field effects. Assets are loaded using a multi-threaded asset streaming system and utilize Direct Storage to copy
				directly to the GPU.

			<p class="experience-description">
				Vultr is a custom 3D Game Engine I built from scratch for Linux with a Vulkan rendering backend. I designed an editor for 
				the engine using ImGui that supports editing materials, assets, the entity hierarchy, levels, and exposed gameplay structs using
				my own macro-based runtime type reflection. All changes in the editor are serialized and deserialized into a YAML format
				on save. The engine uses my own ECS architecture and supports hot-reloading gameplay code through DLLs (including changes to
				component structs), optimized asset imports into a custom runtime file format, and a complete material system that works with
				custom shaders. The engine can render PBR graphics supporting roughness, metalness, normal, and albedo textures. The meshes,
				textures, shaders, and all other assets are loaded using separate thread submission queues to maximize performance. It also uses a
				minimal subset of the C++ STL, opting for a custom template library where possible.
